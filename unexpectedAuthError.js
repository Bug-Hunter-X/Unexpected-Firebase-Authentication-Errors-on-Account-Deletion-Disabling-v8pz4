The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's account is deleted or disabled after the authentication process has begun but before it has completed. This can happen if there's a delay between the authentication request and the server-side response, and the account's status changes in the interim.  The error message may not be immediately clear, making debugging challenging.  For instance, you might get a generic 'auth/internal-error' or a similar non-specific message.
